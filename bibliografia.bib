abstract = {An important paradigm of natural language processing consists of large-scale pre-training on general domain data and adaptation to particular tasks or domains. As we pre-train larger models, full fine-tuning, which retrains all model parameters, becomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an example -- deploying independent instances of fine-tuned models, each with 175B parameters, is prohibitively expensive. We propose Low-Rank Adaptation, or LoRA, which freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks. Compared to GPT-3 175B fine-tuned with Adam, LoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the GPU memory requirement by 3 times. LoRA performs on-par or better than fine-tuning in model quality on RoBERTa, DeBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3, despite having fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput, and, unlike adapters, no additional inference latency. We also provide an empirical investigation into rank-deficiency in language model adaptation, which sheds light on the efficacy of LoRA. We release a package that facilitates the integration of LoRA with PyTorch models and provide our implementations and model checkpoints for RoBERTa, DeBERTa, and GPT-2 at https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA.},

@article{BrownTomB2020LMaF,
abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and
benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on
a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method
still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of
thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language
task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which
current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up
language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes
even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning
approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with
175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model,
and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is
applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot
demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3
achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation,
question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require
on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a
novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time,
we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles,
as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to
training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples
of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from
articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding
and of GPT-3 in general.},

@article{ZhaoWayneXin2023ASoL,
abstract = {Language is essentially a complex, intricate system of human expressions
governed by grammatical rules. It poses a significant challenge to develop
capable AI algorithms for comprehending and grasping a language. As a major
approach, language modeling has been widely studied for language understanding
and generation in the past two decades, evolving from statistical language
models to neural language models. Recently, pre-trained language models (PLMs)
have been proposed by pre-training Transformer models over large-scale corpora,
showing strong capabilities in solving various NLP tasks. Since researchers
have found that model scaling can lead to performance improvement, they further
study the scaling effect by increasing the model size to an even larger size.
Interestingly, when the parameter scale exceeds a certain level, these enlarged
language models not only achieve a significant performance improvement but also
show some special abilities that are not present in small-scale language
models. To discriminate the difference in parameter scale, the research
community has coined the term large language models (LLM) for the PLMs of
significant size. Recently, the research on LLMs has been largely advanced by
both academia and industry, and a remarkable progress is the launch of ChatGPT,
which has attracted widespread attention from society. The technical evolution
of LLMs has been making an important impact on the entire AI community, which
would revolutionize the way how we develop and use AI algorithms. In this
survey, we review the recent advances of LLMs by introducing the background,
key findings, and mainstream techniques. In particular, we focus on four major
aspects of LLMs, namely pre-training, adaptation tuning, utilization, and
capacity evaluation. Besides, we also summarize the available resources for
developing LLMs and discuss the remaining issues for future directions.},
